### Simple game of domino
We have two players who play this game.

Each time you start the game a new set is created and every player gets a random set of tiles.

Every time a random player starts the game.

To show which tile comes from where every tile has a color:
* Red is the tile the game starts with.
* Blue is Sanne
* Green is Jip

There are two ways a player can win the game:
* Being the first who has no more tiles left.
* The other player can't pick a tile because the stock is empty

To play the game first do a `composer.phar install` and then run `php domino.php`
